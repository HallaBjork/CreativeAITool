# Creative Process Evolution
### CPPN-NEAT Model - Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC)

This creative AI application was made as a part of a research project for the MSc Data Science & AI for the Creative Industries final thesis, Autumn 2021.

The model was inspired by the project <a href="https://nbenko1.github.io/#/" target="_blank">Picbreeder</a> and adapted from Hardmaru`s project Neurogram, an implementation of CPPN-NEAT algorithm with some variations. The drawing board is adapted from <a href="https://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/" target="_blank">Harmony</a> source code and the brushes <em>Sketchy</em>, <em>Shaded</em>, <em>Chrome</em>, <em>Fur</em>, <em>LongFur</em> and <em>Web</em> were first implemented in <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/scribbler/" target="_blank">The Scribbler.
